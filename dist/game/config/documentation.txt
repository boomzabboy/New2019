This is your servers configuration folder. 

All the configuration files inside the ./config/default/ folder are the
original default configuration files. The default configuration files should
never be changed.

To change a config directive from a file inside ./config/default/, create a
file with the same name inside the ./config/ folder and only put the configs
directives inside it which you want to change.

For file formats other than .properties, you need to create a complete
configuration file to overwrite the default.

This construct enables you to just overwrite with a new server version without
overwriting your custom configurations.
